                    Hello! I am a software developer based in the North West of the UK.
                    With a genuine passion for technology and a constant drive to expand my skillset, I thrive on tackling new challenges and finding innovative solutions.
                    My approachable and friendly demeanor helps me collaborate effectively within teams and build lasting relationships.
                    Outside of coding, I enjoy hitting the gym, exploring the great outdoors and experimenting in the kitchen.
                </p>

                    Iâ€™m eager to bring my enthusiasm and dedication to a dynamic team where I can contribute to impactful projects and continue growing both professionally and personally.
